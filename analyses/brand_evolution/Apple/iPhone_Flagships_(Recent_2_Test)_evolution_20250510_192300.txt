Given the lack of data, I can only speculate on potential trends based on general knowledge of iPhone reviews during the iPhone 11 Pro Max (2019) and iPhone 12 Pro Max (2020) era.

1.  **Overall Sentiment Trend:** It's likely that the overall sentiment was generally positive for both generations, typical of iPhone flagship releases. However, the iPhone 12 Pro Max probably received slightly more positive reviews due to the introduction of 5G connectivity and the redesigned form factor. The iPhone 11 Pro Max was praised for its significant camera improvements and battery life.

2.  **Evolution of Key Positive Features:**
    *   **Camera:** The camera system was a major highlight for both generations. The iPhone 11 Pro Max introduced the triple-lens system with significant low-light performance improvements. The iPhone 12 Pro Max further refined this with computational photography enhancements and sensor improvements.
    *   **Performance:** Both phones offered excellent performance thanks to Apple's A-series chips. The iPhone 12 Pro Max likely had a slight edge due to the newer A14 Bionic chip.
    *   **Design:** The iPhone 12 Pro Max introduced a new flat-edged design, which was generally well-received, marking a departure from the curved edges of the iPhone 11 Pro Max.

3.  **Evolution of Key Negative Features/Criticisms:**
    *   **Price:** The high price point was a consistent criticism across both generations.
    *   **Charging Speed:** Apple's slow charging speed compared to competitors was a recurring complaint.
    *   **Lack of Innovation (Incremental Updates):** Some reviewers may have felt that the updates from one generation to the next were incremental rather than revolutionary.

4.  **Shifts in Reviewer Focus:** With the iPhone 12 Pro Max, reviewers likely paid more attention to 5G connectivity and the impact of the new A14 Bionic chip on performance and efficiency. The design change was also a significant point of focus.

5.  **Impact of Competition:** Competition from Android devices, particularly in areas like camera technology and charging speed, likely influenced reviewer perception. Apple's competitors were pushing boundaries in these areas, putting pressure on Apple to innovate.
