--- Textual Summary from Gemini ---
The overall sentiment trend towards Apple's iPhone flagships, specifically comparing the iPhone 11 Pro Max (2019) and iPhone 12 Pro Max (2020), reveals a generally positive but nuanced perspective. Reviewers consistently acknowledge the premium nature of these devices, but their enthusiasm is tempered by concerns about price, incremental upgrades, and competitive pressures. While the iPhone 11 Pro Max was largely seen as a solid, albeit expensive, upgrade, the iPhone 12 Pro Max faced more scrutiny, with some reviewers questioning whether its improvements justified the extra cost, especially compared to other iPhone 12 models or previous generations.

Key positive features consistently praised include the camera system, battery life, and performance. The camera system, particularly the video recording capabilities, was a major selling point for both generations. The iPhone 11 Pro Max introduced the triple-lens system and improved low-light performance, earning praise for its versatility and ease of use. The iPhone 12 Pro Max further refined the camera, with a larger sensor and improved stabilization, but some reviewers felt the image quality differences compared to other iPhone 12 models were minimal. Battery life was another consistent strength, with the iPhone 11 Pro Max lauded for its significant improvement over previous models. The iPhone 12 Pro Max also delivered good battery life, although some reviews suggested it was comparable to or slightly less than the 11 Pro Max. Performance, driven by Apple's A-series chips, was consistently excellent, ensuring smooth and responsive operation. The design, while appreciated for its premium materials and matte finish, also drew criticism for its size and weight, particularly with the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

Recurring criticisms include the high price, lack of innovation, and certain missing features. The high price point was a consistent concern, with reviewers questioning the value for money, especially considering the limited base storage and incremental upgrades. The lack of innovation was another recurring theme, with some reviewers feeling that Apple was playing catch-up with features already present in other phones. Specific missing features, such as 5G connectivity on the iPhone 11 Pro Max and a high refresh rate display on both generations, were also noted as drawbacks.

Over time, reviewers started paying more attention to specific aspects of the iPhone flagships. Camera performance remained a key focus, but reviewers increasingly emphasized video recording capabilities and low-light performance. Battery life continued to be important, but reviewers also considered charging speed and wireless charging capabilities. Design remained a factor, but reviewers paid more attention to ergonomics and usability, particularly the size and weight of the phones.

Competitive pressures influenced Apple's product evolution and reviewer perception. The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra was frequently compared to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPhone 12 Pro Max, with reviewers highlighting the S20 Ultra's superior display, zoom capabilities, and faster charging. The Huawei Mate 40 Pro was also mentioned as a competitor in camera performance, particularly in night mode. These comparisons suggest that Apple was under pressure to innovate and compete with other brands in key areas.

The non-verbal cues from the video reviews often corroborated the textual analysis. For example, reviewers' smiles when showing camera samples and frowns when discussing the high price reinforced their positive and negative sentiments. Similarly, reviewers' hand gestures and body language when comparing the sizes of different iPhones emphasized the practical implications of the size differences.
