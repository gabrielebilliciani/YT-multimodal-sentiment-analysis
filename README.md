# Advanced Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Product Reviews using Multimodal AI

This repository contains the Python codebase for the project "Advanced Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Product Reviews using Multimodal AI".

For a comprehensive understanding of the project's objectives, methodology, system design, experiments, and evaluation, please refer to the full **Project Report PDF document**.

## Codebase Highlights (Complementary to Project Report)

The Project Report often refers to the codebase for complete examples of AI prompts, expected JSON structures, and samples of generated outputs. This section highlights key locations within the codebase where these complementary materials can be found:

*   **Phase 1 (Individual Video Analysis) Prompts & JSON Structures:**
    *   **Consumer Products:** Detailed prompts for relevance checking, full video analysis, and the requested JSON output structure for consumer products (e.g. smartphones) are located in:
        *   [`codebase/configs/prompts_consumer.py`](./codebase/configs/prompts_consumer.py) (see `GEMINI_RELEVANCE_CHECK_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`, `GEMINI_ANALYSIS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`, and `GEMINI_JSON_STRUCTURE_REQUEST`).
    *   **SaaS Products:** Tailored prompts for the two-tier relevance/suitability check, full video analysis, and the specific JSON output structure for B2B SaaS products (e.g. CRM software) can be found in:
        *   [`codebase/configs/prompts_saas.py`](./codebase/configs/prompts_saas.py) (see `GEMINI_SAAS_TYPE_RELEVANCE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`, `GEMINI_SAAS_SUITABILITY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`, and `GEMINI_SAAS_JSON_STRUCTURE_REQUEST`).

*   **Phase 2 (Synthesised Insights) Prompts:**
    *   Prompts designed to instruct the AI to synthesise multiple individual analyses into broader reports (longitudinal brand evolution and comparative product analysis) are available in:
        *   [`codebase/analysis/analysis_prompts.py`](./codebase/analysis/analysis_prompts.py) (see `LONGITUDINAL_BRAND_EVOLUTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` and `COMPARATIVE_PRODUCT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`).

*   **Example Generated Outputs:**
    *   The Project Report includes snippets and discusses example outputs. Full examples of the `.json` and `.txt` report files generated by the Phase 2 synthesis process are stored in the:
        *   [`codebase/analyses/`](./codebase/analyses/) directory.

## Repository Structure

Below is an overview of the main directories of the `/codebase` directory and their purpose:

*   [`main.py`](./codebase/main.py): The main entry point and orchestrator script for executing Phase 1 of the analysis (data ingestion and individual video multimodal analysis).
*   [`config.py`](./codebase/config.py): Acts as the primary configuration loader for the application. It imports settings from the `configs/` sub-package and provides helper functions to access specific prompt configurations based on product category.
*   [`analysis/`](./codebase/analysis/): Contains all modules related to **Phase 2** of the project â€“ generating synthesised insights and reports from the data collected in Phase 1.
    *   [`analysis_prompts.py`](./codebase/analysis/analysis_prompts.py): Stores the detailed Gemini prompt templates used for generating longitudinal and comparative analysis reports.
    *   [`data_loader.py`](./codebase/analysis/data_loader.py): Responsible for fetching and preparing the individual video analysis JSONs from the MongoDB database for input into Phase 2 synthesis.
    *   [`report_generator.py`](./codebase/analysis/report_generator.py): Manages the process of sending data to Gemini for synthesis and saving the resulting textual and structured JSON reports. It also includes a `if __name__ == '__main__':` block for standalone execution and testing of Phase 2.
*   [`configs/`](./configs/): This sub-package holds all specific configuration files for the project, including API keys (via `.env`), product lists, reviewer lists, and AI prompt templates.
    *   [`product_catalog.py`](./codebase/configs/product_catalog.py): Defines the `PRODUCTS_TO_ANALYZE` dictionary, detailing the products targeted by the system.
    *   [`prompts_consumer.py`](./codebase/configs/prompts_consumer.py): Contains specific Gemini prompt templates and JSON structure definitions for the analysis of consumer electronics.
    *   [`prompts_saas.py`](./codebase/configs/prompts_saas.py): Contains specific Gemini prompt templates and JSON structure definitions for the tiered analysis of SaaS products.
    *   [`reviewer_lists.py`](./codebase/configs/reviewer_lists.py): Defines the `REVIEWER_CHANNELS` dictionary, listing curated YouTube channels for certain product categories.
    *   [`settings.py`](./codebase/configs/settings.py): Handles loading of environment variables (like API keys from a `.env` file), defines application modes (Test/Production), and sets default parameters for API calls.
*   [`core/`](./core/): This sub-package contains core modules responsible for interacting with external APIs (YouTube, Gemini) and the database (MongoDB) during **Phase 1**.
    *   [`database_manager.py`](./codebase/core/database_manager.py): Manages all operations related to the MongoDB database, including connection, data saving, and querying.
    *   [`gemini_client.py`](./codebase/core/gemini_client.py): Provides functions to interact with the Google Gemini API for relevance checking, multimodal video analysis, and synthesis tasks.
    *   [`youtube_client.py`](./codebase/core/youtube_client.py): Provides functions to interact with the YouTube Data API v3 for discovering videos.
*   [`analyses/`](./codebase/analyses/): This directory is the designated output location for the `.txt` and `.json` files generated during Phase 2 (report synthesis). It contains example outputs that can be reviewed.
*   [`utils/`](./utils/): Contains utility modules used across the project.
    *   [`logging_config.py`](./codebase/utils/logging_config.py): Provides a centralized setup for application-wide logging.
    *   [`helpers.py`](./codebase/utils/helpers.py): (Currently empty) A placeholder for any general-purpose helper functions that might be developed.
